# 01 — Project Overview & Strategy

> **AETERNA 2026**: Opinionated Execution Engine  
> **Status**: Foundation Complete

---

## Core Vision

> **"Kill the Year, Own the Week."**

We don't solve procrastination—we solve the existential crisis of high-achievers who are busy but strategically stagnant.

---

## The Problem (1% Pain)

### 🎯 The "Yearly Illusion" Trap
- 12-month cycles create false security
- **92% of yearly resolutions fail** due to lost urgency in first 9 months

### 🎭 Productivity Theater (Notion Trap)
- Users trapped in **"Administrative Hell"**
- Busy decorating templates, zero execution on needle-moving goals

### 💫 Output Illusion vs. Existential Drift
- Solopreneurs spend **73% of time on admin**
- Feel **busy** but strategically **stagnant**
- Emotional disconnect between boring daily tasks and 10-year vision

### 🪞 Lack of Brutal Honesty
- Without objective scoring, humans lie to themselves
- No accountability mechanism for execution level

## The Solution (Antidote)

### Positioning
> AETERNA 2026 is an **Opinionated Execution Engine**, not just a planner app.

### Four Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Time Compression** | 12-week cycles. Each week = month. Each day = week. |
| **Opinionated Workflow** | Eliminate decision fatigue. System dictates the right way. |
| **Zero-Friction Entry** | Input in <3s via WhatsApp/PWA. Faster than thinking. |
| **Identity-Level AI** | AI as Legacy Partner. Empowering feedback, not shaming. |

### Differentiating Features (The Moat)

- **Execution Recovery Mirror**: Recovery metrics as performance indicators
- **85% Rule**: Absolute scoring. Below 85% = Rebuild Mode
- **Notion Migration**: One-click import from "Digital Graveyard"
- **Visual Lineage**: Connect daily tasks to 10-year legacy

## Business Validation
